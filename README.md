### Requirements

1) PHP 7.1+
2) Composer installed on your computer and added in your system PATH.

### Set up

1. Clone project
2. cd into project
3. run ``composer install``
4. run ``php artisan serve``
5. run ``php artisan csv:json``
6. Done

## Unit Tests

run ``./vedor/bin/phpunit``

#### Shortcuts and design 

1) Complete the unit tests and increase code coverage to 90%+
2) I didn't have time to do clean up and small refactoring for consistently and mistakes.
3) If I had more time, i would try to figure out away NOT to use laravel validator (maybe build one)
